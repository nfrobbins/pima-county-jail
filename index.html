      <div class="body-text">
        <p> Twelve people died in custody at the Pima County Jail in 2022. The jail, located in Tucson, Arizona, has an average population that hovers around 1,838. This means that for every 100,000 inmates, 653 will die. This number is four times as high as the national average, and twice as high the rate of death at Rikers Island in 2022.
        <p>Deaths have increased, in part, because the jail is understaffed with correctional officers, making it hard to supervise the inmates, many of which are in a state of intoxication or withdrawal from fentanyl, the newly popular, heavily addictive, swiftly deadly opiate. </p>
        <p>"The fentanyl was just pouring in there," said Chris Copeland, a former Pima County Sheriff's Department corrections officer who spent 15 years working at the jail.</p>
        <p> Fifteen of 16 in-custody jail deaths since 2017 classified by the Pima County Medical Examiner as "accidents" were drug overdoses. A total of 20 deaths over the last five years involved drugs, meaning the inmate had drugs in their system when the medical examiner ruled they died from other causes.</p></div>

        <p>In a December 2022 letter to the Pima County Board of Supervisors, Sheriff Chris Nanos said the jail is operating in a state of "full-blown crisis." He urged the board to implement a half-cent "jail tax," to be put towards hiring and training staff, and the construction of a new facility.  </p>
         <p>As of November of this year, eight people have died while in custody at the Pima County Jail.</p>
