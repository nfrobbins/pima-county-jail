        <p>I am an Arizona-born, New York City-based writer, journalist, editor and photographer. I will graduate from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY with an MA in Journalism in May 2024.</p>
        <p>I covered housing and homelessness, incarceration, and arts & culture as a reporting fellow for the Tucson Sentinel.  My work has also appeared in the New York City News Service, where it received nominations for the Best News Story and the Ernie Pyle Human-Interest Profile Awards from the Associate Collegiate Press.  </p>

            <p> When Petey Mesquitey gets recognized, it's usually by his voice. Sometimes in the checkout line at Trader Joe's, the cashier will ask how his day is going. After he answers, there is a long pause, and then a spark of recognition.
